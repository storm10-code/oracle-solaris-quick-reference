Change MTU

To display the current mtu of an interface

# dladm show-linkprop -p mtu bge0
LINK         PROPERTY        PERM VALUE          DEFAULT        POSSIBLE
bge0         mtu             rw   1500           1500           1500
To set the mtu to enable jumbo frames

# dladm set-linkprop -p mtu=9000 bge0
To set the mtu to not use jumbo frames

# dladm set-linkprop -p mtu=1500 bge0

edit /kernel/drv/ixgbe.conf
default_mtu = 9000;

ldm set-vswitch mtu=9000 vsw-10g-priv-primary

Solaris 11: Network Configuration Advanced
 matthew.mattoon  March 29, 2011
In my previous post we went over the basics of configuring a network interface in Solaris 11, without using the Network Auto Magic (NWAM) which is enabled by default.  In this article we will go over some of the more advanced features which can be leveraged including VLANs, aggregation groups, and jumbo frames.

Configure VLAN Tagging

Create a VLAN, specify the VLAN id with the “-v”, then specify the interface with the “-l”, and finally create a name for the tagged interface (in this case user0 since this particular system is the user VLAN, if you have more descriptive names of your VLANs you can use them here).

# dladm create-vlan -v 20 -l bge0 user0
# dladm show-vlan
LINK            VID      OVER         FLAGS
user0           20       bge0         -----
# ipadm show-if
IFNAME     STATE    CURRENT      PERSISTENT
lo0        ok       -m-v------46 ---
bge0       ok       bm--------46 -46
user0      ok       bm--------46 -46
For simplicity I will delete the IP configuration on the untagged interface.

# ipadm delete-addr bge0/v4
As we did in our previous article you can now create an IP configuration on top of the new tagged interface (which in this case is DHCP).

# ipadm create-addr -T dhcp user0/v4
Keep in mind if you change the VLAN you will most likely need to change your default route.  The below options “-fp” f will flush meaning delete all current routes, while the p will make the new settings persistent.  In this case afterwards we will only have 192.168.100.1 as a default gateway.

# route -fp add default 192.168.100.1
Delete a VLAN

If you have used the VLAN before you will need to “unwind” the configuration before deleting the VLAN.

# ipadm delete-addr user0/v4
# ipadm delete-if user0
Now that this is done you can delete the VLAN.

# dladm delete-vlan user0
Create an Aggregation Group

With this command we create a new aggregation group and assign interfaces to the aggregation group.  If the interface is already in use then you will need to delete the interface before adding it to an aggregation group.

# dladm create-aggr -l bnx0 -l bnx1 aggr0
Now we can view the details of our aggregation group.

# dladm show-aggr
LINK            POLICY   ADDRPOLICY           LACPACTIVITY  LACPTIMER   FLAGS
aggr0           L4       auto                 off           short       -----
# dladm show-link
LINK        CLASS     MTU    STATE    BRIDGE     OVER
bnx0        phys      1500   up     --         --
bnx1        phys      1500   up       --         --
aggr0       aggr      1500   up  --         bnx0, bnx1
Now we add an IP configuration against the aggregated interface.

# ipadm create-addr -T static -a 192.168.100.172/24 aggr0/v4
Modify an Aggregration Group

If you need to add or remove an interface from an aggregation group then the following commands will allow you to do that.

# dladm add-aggr -l bnx2 aggr0
# dladm remove-aggr -l bnx1 aggr0
You can also adjust the LACP Policy using the below command.  Where L4 is L2, L3, L4, or any combination of them based on the desired behavior.

# dladm modify-aggr -P L4 aggr0
The LACP mode can be configured using the below command where active is either auto, active, or passive.  Additionally if configuring active mode you must also configure a timer value of short or long, this option is not needed for auto or passive.

# dladm modify-aggr -L active -T short aggr0
Delete Aggregation Group

Delete the IP configuration from the aggregation group

# ipadm delete-addr aggr0/v4
Delete the Aggregated Interface

# ipadm delete-if aggr0
Delete the Aggregation Group

# dladm delete-aggr aggr0
Enable Jumbo Frames
