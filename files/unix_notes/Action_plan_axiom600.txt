1.) Verify the Axiom is in a good state to perform the downgrade
    - Slammers need to be powered-off 

2.) Downgrade Axiom firmware to official 05.04.18
    What are we downgrading - the Slammers powered off?
	
3.) Replace the disk-drives on Brick005 and Brick001 as per action plan

4.) Wait 10 minutes for the Brick replacements

5.) When Pilots are ready for the COD reset, the pilots will reboot and we will need to poweron the slammers
