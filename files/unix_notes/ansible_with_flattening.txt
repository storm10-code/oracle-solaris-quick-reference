Flattening A List
Note

This is an uncommon thing to want to do, but we’re documenting it for completeness. You probably won’t be reaching for this one often.

In rare instances you might have several lists of lists, and you just want to iterate over every item in all of those lists. Assume a really crazy hypothetical datastructure:

----
# file: roles/foo/vars/main.yml
packages_base:
  - [ 'foo-package', 'bar-package' ]
packages_apps:
  - [ ['one-package', 'two-package' ]]
  - [ ['red-package'], ['blue-package']]
As you can see the formatting of packages in these lists is all over the place. How can we install all of the packages in both lists?:

- name: flattened loop demo
  yum:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: present
  with_flattened:
     - "{{ packages_base }}"
     - "{{ packages_apps }}"
