Health Checks

Hi Oracle Support Team, 

We are currently planning an upgrade on our Production Axiom 600 storage arrays from software release 05.04.14 to 05.04.18.

Our current process when upgrading the software is to log SR# with yourselves for a pre-health check. Additionally for Axioms with two slammers
we currently perform a two stage Alternative Non Disruptive Upgrade to avoid upgrade failing during Brick Firmware phase (Doc ID 1560210.1), 
as previous software upgrades resulted in Cold restarts of the storage array; this is currently agreed by our Service Account Manager.

Details

1.) Perform a pre-health check of the storage array in view that it will be upgraded to 05.04.18 
2.) WebEx session to perform the "Alternative Non Disruptive Upgrade Procedure" from 05.04.14 -> 05.04.18
