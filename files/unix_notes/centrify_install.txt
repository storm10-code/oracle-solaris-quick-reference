Remove and re-install agent features
If yon have problems upgrading any agent features, such as access
control and privilege management or auditing services, you should do
the following:
 Log on as root and disable auditing on UNIX computers where
auditing is enabled:
dacontrol -d
 Use the adleave command to remove the UNIX computer from its
current zone and Active Directory domain.
 Use the DirectAuthorize Agent Control Panel to remove the local
Windows computer from its current zone, then use the Windows
Control Panel application to remove the agent services from the
local computer.
 Rerun the install.sh script or the agent setup program to install
the agent cleanly.
You can join the domain from the installation script on UNIX
computers or join a zone from the agent configuration wizard on
Windows computers.
 Log on as root and enable auditing on UNIX computers where you
want auditing enabled
dacontrol -e
