Pointless use of echo.

echo -e is used when assigning variables for some odd reason.

# Screenfetch
mydistro=$(echo -e "$labelcolor OS:$textcolor $distro $sysArch")

# Correct way
mydistro="$labelcolor OS:$textcolor $ditro $sysArch"

# Screenfetch
for l in $(echo $distrib_id); do

# Correct way
for l in "$distrib_id"; do

# Screenfetch
if [ $(echo $cpu_mhz) -gt 999 ]; then

# Correct way
if ((cpu_mhz > 999)); then

# Screenfetch
[[ "$(cat /etc/os-release)" =~ "Raspbian" ]]

# Bash - No external processes.
[[ "$(< /etc/os-release)" =~ "Raspbian" ]]

# Screenfetch
distro_more="$(cat /usr/share/doc/tc/release.txt)"

# Bash - No external processes.
distro_more="$(< /usr/share/doc/tc/release.txt)"

Test syntax is inconsistent.

Sometimes [ is used, other times [[ is used.

[[ should be used over [.
[[ is bash syntax whereas [ is a builtin command.
[[ is safer since variables don't have to be quoted.
[[ supports more features like combining tests.

(Exception: "$@" to expand to the list of positional parameters, e.g. "$@ is equivalent to "$1" "$2" "$3" if there are three positional parameters. See What is the difference between $* and $@?)
